tagline: BCH node + solo pool
description: >-
  Run a Bitcoin Cash full node (BCHN) and an integrated solo Stratum v1 pool (ckpool) as a single app.


  Features:
    - Axe-style dashboard for node sync and pool stats
    - CashAddr to legacy payout address conversion for ckpool compatibility
    - Difficulty presets (vardiff) tuned for home miners
    - Blocks view for solved blocks, plus optional history scan
    - Support ticket submission with basic diagnostics


  Miner connection:
    - Set your payout address in the app Settings tab.
    - URL: `stratum+tcp://<your-host-ip>:4567`
    - Username: worker name (optional). `walletAddress.workername` also works, but it does not control payout.
      Example: `rig01.workername`
    - Password: anything


  Notes:
    - For maximum compatibility, use a legacy BCH Base58 address (`1...` / `3...`) as the payout address.
    - Many wallets (e.g. Trust Wallet) show CashAddr (`q...` / `p...`). AxeBCH automatically converts CashAddr to legacy format for ckpool compatibility and shows the converted address.
    - Conversion happens locally on your device; AxeBCH does not send your address to any external service.
    - Reference converter (CashAddr <-> legacy): https://bch.info/en/tools/cashaddr
    - Solo mining is extremely unlikely to find blocks without significant hashrate.
    - First sync can be slow on small or busy systems. SSD strongly recommended.


  Components:
    - Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) full node (MIT): https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node
    - ckpool (GPLv3) solo pool engine: https://github.com/ctubio/ckpool


  Status:
    - BETA build: expect bugs and breaking changes. Verify payout addresses before mining.
