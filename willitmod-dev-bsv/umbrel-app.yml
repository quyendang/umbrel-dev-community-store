tagline: BSV node + solo pool
description: >-
  IMPORTANT: AMD64/x86_64 only. ARM/arm64 (Raspberry Pi) is not supported because the BSV node image (bitcoinsv/bitcoin-sv:1.2.0) is amd64-only.

  Run a Bitcoin SV full node and a solo Stratum v1 pool (ckpool) as a single app.


  Miner connection:
    - URL: `stratum+tcp://<node-ip>:8901`
    - Username: worker name (optional)
    - Password: anything


  Notes:
    - Payout address must be a legacy Base58 address (`1...` / `3...`). CashAddr is not supported.
    - ARM/arm64 is not supported (no official arm64 node image for this build).
    - ALPHA: expect breaking changes while this is being tested on 5tratumOS.


  Blockchain data disclaimer:
    - Blockchains may contain third‑party content (including arbitrary data) that could be illegal, harmful, or offensive in some jurisdictions.
    - By running this app you may download, store, and serve blockchain data; you are responsible for complying with local laws and for your own operational security.
    - Bitcoin SV in particular has historically permitted large data payloads; do not run this node if you are not comfortable with the risks.
