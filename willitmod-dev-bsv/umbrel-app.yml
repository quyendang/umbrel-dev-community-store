tagline: BSV node + solo pool
description: >-
  IMPORTANT: AMD64/x86_64 only. ARM/arm64 (Raspberry Pi) is not supported because the BSV node image (bitcoinsv/bitcoin-sv:1.2.0) is amd64-only.

  Run a Bitcoin SV full node and a solo Stratum v1 pool (ckpool) as a single app.


  Miner connection:
    - URL: `stratum+tcp://<node-ip>:8901`
    - Username: worker name (optional)
    - Password: anything


  Notes:
    - Payout address must be a legacy Base58 address (`1...` / `3...`). CashAddr is not supported.
    - ARM/arm64 is not supported (no official arm64 node image for this build).
    - ALPHA: expect breaking changes while this is being tested on 5tratumOS.


  Blockchain data note (BSV):
    - BTC, BCH, and BSV can all carry arbitrary data; BSV historically allowed larger payloads (scale differs, not the principle).
    - This app enables pruning by default (`prune=2500`) to keep only a small rolling tail of recent blocks and reduce retained history.
    - Chain data is not indexed/searchable as media by default; accessing or reconstructing content requires deliberate tooling.
    - If you have legal/optics concerns, don’t install this app (or remove it).
