tagline: BSV node + solo pool
description: >-
  IMPORTANT: AMD64/x86_64 only. ARM/arm64 (Raspberry Pi) is not supported because the BSV node image (bitcoinsv/bitcoin-sv:1.2.0) is amd64-only.

  Run a Bitcoin SV full node and a solo Stratum v1 pool (ckpool) as a single app.


  Miner connection:
    - URL: `stratum+tcp://<node-ip>:8901`
    - Username: worker name (optional)
    - Password: anything


  Notes:
    - Payout address must be a legacy Base58 address (`1...` / `3...`). CashAddr is not supported.
    - ARM/arm64 is not supported (no official arm64 node image for this build).
    - ALPHA: expect breaking changes while this is being tested on 5tratumOS.


  Sync, data, and pruning (positive + safe defaults):
    - Full node sync can take a long time and a lot of bandwidth/storage (it downloads and validates the chain).
    - Blockchains can carry arbitrary data (e.g. via `OP_RETURN`). BTC/BCH/BSV all have this; BSV historically allowed larger payloads (difference is scale, not principle).
    - To reduce retained history and eliminate as much risk as possible, AxeBSV makes pruning mandatory:
      - default `prune=2500`
      - maximum `prune=5000` (safety cap)
    - On BSV node v1.2+ the chain data isn't exposed as searchable/viewable media by default; reconstruction requires deliberate tooling.
    - If you have legal/optics concerns, don't install this app (or remove it).
