version: "0.7.75-dev"
tagline: BTC node + solo pool
description: >-
  Run a Bitcoin (BTC) full node (Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots) and a solo Stratum v1 pool (ckpool) as a single Umbrel app installation.


  IMPORTANT (DEV update):
    - AxeBTCF (Fractal merged mining) has been removed because it was unstable for many users.
    - Updating to this version permanently removes Fractal support from this app ID.
    - Your Bitcoin node data is kept, but Fractal data is no longer used.


  On first launch after updating, AxeBTC will show a popup offering to delete old Fractal node data to reclaim disk space.
  If you accept, Fractal data will be deleted.
  If you choose "Not now", the data is left on disk but will remain unused by AxeBTC.


  Miner connection:
    - URL: `stratum+tcp://<your-umbrel-ip>:7890` (use an IP address, not `umbrel.local`)
    - Username: worker name (optional)
    - Password: anything


  Notes:
    - Set your payout address in the app Settings tab.
    - On first launch you must pick Bitcoin Core vs Knots before sync starts.
    - Switching Core/Knots triggers an in-app migration and can take a while; avoid restarting the app or powering off Umbrel while it migrates.
    - BTC payout addresses support bech32 (`bc1...`) and legacy (`1...` / `3...`). Bitcoin Cash CashAddr (`q...` / `p...`) is not supported.
